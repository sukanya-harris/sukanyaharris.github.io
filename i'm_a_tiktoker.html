        <h3 style="margin: 2px;">September 5, 2019</h3>
    <p style="font-size:180%; margin: 20px;">This is the story all about how my life got twisted upside down. So why not take a minute and sit right there, I'll tell you about the time, I became a tiktoker. *music continues* No but seriously, I was more than content just looking at the tiktok memes via Twitter but somehow I got roped into downloading the app and sometimes spend unnecessary times watching. My friend Uzi brought me to this mountain and the climb (lol) is steep! I've gotten to the point where I started to record them. Like what? What do I expect to be, tiktok famous? Actually yes give me money. I don't know, they're kind of fun to make so maybe I'll keep going. Just know Uzi this is all your fault.<br><br> It's kind of weird how TikTok became something from Musical.ly which became something from Vine. Of course Vine is the best option out of all of these but TikTok isn't that bad. I never used Musical.ly unfortunately but its quick run says something huh? Other than that I'm not much of an in your face social media person to begin with. I rarely comment on things (unless it's Twitter then I got a lot to say), I mostly like to spend my time absorbing the content. I am completely content with just that. Of course I did try to go the YouTube scene but I guess I'm not much of a vlogger plus I don't have the time to do what I want creatively. It was a little bit of a struggle but maybe someday I would like to go back to that.<br><br> Can I just say that Twitter is a nest for people to post dumb stuff and then get roasted. And can I just say that I am one of the roasters. Yes I know I said I rarely comment on social media but Twitter is literally in its own playing field sooooo......ANYWAY it's amazing to see people's different viewpoints and experiences and based on that information I can roast a plethera(I'm educated) of jokes for mostly for myself to enjoy. Mostly myself because my followers consist of my friends, siblings, and randos. Everyone go follow me on Twitter now! Like my retweets of dogs and memes! If I can't get TikTok famous, might as well go for Twitter. I wonder if I could get GroupMe famous.</p>
