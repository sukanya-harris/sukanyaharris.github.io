    <p style="font-size:180%; margin: 20px;">This is the story all about how my life got twisted upside down. So why not take a minute and sit right there, I'll tell you about the time, I became a tiktoker. *music continues* No but seriously, I was more than content just looking at the tiktok memes via Twitter but somehow I got roped into downloading the app and sometimes spend unnecessary times watching. My friend Uzi brought me to this mountain and the climb (lol) is steep! I've gotten to the point where I started to record them. Like what? What do I expect to be, tiktok famous? Actually yes give me money. I don't know, they're kind of fun to make so maybe I'll keep going. Just know Uzi this is all your fault.</p>
